LimeCrypt
=========
LimeCrypt wants to provide an easy C++ interface to some cryptographic
functionality without bothering the user with much details. LimeCrypt 
is in essence a wrapper around _some_ of the [Crypto++ Libary][1] with 
an interface that is simple to use. 

Currently the library provides methods for:

* RSA Public/Private Key cryptography
    * Key pair generation (and store to file, load from file)
    * Signing/Verification (Recovery and Appendix Schemes)
    * Encryption/Decryption
* Symmetric AES encryption/decryption
